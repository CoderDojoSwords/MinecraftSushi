# MinecraftSushi
Welcome to MinecraftSushi!
This repository is to complement the Minecraft Forge starter kit available at www.coderdojoswords.com/resources/
The kit contains:
- Pre-built Minecraft Forge (1.7)
- Eclipse JDE (Luna)
- Oracle Java SDK (7u91)
- Convenient launch scripts

The Windows kits are distributed as self-extracting archives.
* Once you download a suitable kit
* Extract it to a location that has no spaces, e.g. C:\MinecraftForge
** This restriction is in Forge itself, and we have no way around that.
* Run the resetWorkspace.bat script (resetWorkspace.sh if on Linux)
** This will regenerate the Eclipse workspace for its new location
* Run startEclipse.bat/.sh
* Have fun!
